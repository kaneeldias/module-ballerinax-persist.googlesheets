This library provides Ballerina `persist` Tooling for Google Sheets, which provides functionality to store and query data conveniently through a data model instead of using Google Sheets API.

The `persist` commands will make it easy to enable Ballerina Persistence Layer in a bal project. With this support, users need not worry about the persistence layer in a project. Users can define an entity data model, validate the model and generate `persist` clients for Google Sheets, which provide convenient APIs to store and query data in a data store.

For more information, see [`persist` API Documentation](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerinax/persist.googlesheets/latest).
